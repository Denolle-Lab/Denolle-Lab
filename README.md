# Denolle Lab Website

This is the website of our academic research group at University of Washington.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. We tried to make it simple yet adaptable, so that it is easy for you to use it as a template. Please feel free to copy and modify for your own purposes.  You don't have to link to us or mention us (but of course we appreciate it).


Guidelines for group members:
* fork the gh-pages branch. Make changes on your local, pull request to merge your fork to the gh-pages branch.
* _data/*.yml files to add your content:
