# Earthquake
---
#### We characterize the dynamics of earthquakes from both observations and simulations. We hope to validate physical models by making new observational tools to constrain the physical models of earthquake dynamics. A main endeavor in observational seismology is to accurately and correctly recover the seismic source pulse from radiated seismic waves (appropriate Green's function), and constrain earthquake dynamics (source time function, stress drop, radiated energy). Our physical understanding and models of earthquake ought to be validated against appropriate observations. We develop new tools to validate these models. Some examples are below.

## Relating Earthquake Backprojection to Earthquake Kinematics 
Although the backprojection (BP) methods have been successful in studying large earthquakes, the physical interpretations of the BP results are still not clear. All those previous comparisons between independent methods are qualitative. Obviously, better understandings on the BP images and their relation to the physics of earthquake rupture is significant and highly needed. In this study, we start from the theoretical formulation of the BP images, which is linear in the frequency domain, and carry on a synthetic exercise in a homogeneous fullspace. We find that the fundamental linear formulation of the BP method is most correlated with the true kinematic source properties: the images from linear BP is a snapshot of the slip motion after a spatial smoothing with a frequency-dependent resolution matrix. This direct relation between BP image and source kinematics helps to better understand and interpret the BP observations of the real earthquake rupture. Besides, the behavior of resolution matrix provides a quantitative way to evaluate the resolution of BP methods.

## Source Pulse and Spectra 
Moment-rate functions with a single time scale can be modeled with a simple spectral model with a flat asymptote at low frequency and a decay of w-2  decay at high frequencies. The dominant time scale is the source duration of the pulse. We investigate the shape of the source spectra as seen from tele seismic P waves to establish the dominant time scales in the moment rate function of moderate and large earthquakes globally recorded.

## Earthquake Radiated Energy (Denolle)
During an earthquake, the energy released partitions between fracturing of the rock, heating due to friction, and radiation of seismic waves. Kinetic energy carried by seismic waves is a dynamic measure of rupture processes. Our group research focuses on accurately measuring radiated energy and establishing its relation to static measures such as seismic moment, focal mechanism, source depth.

## Earthquake Stress Drop
Static stress drop is the total change of shear stress on the fault from the earthquake, integrated over the fault area. Our group investigate the two approaches to estimating stress drop. First, from corner frequency measurements we can infer a source duration and from assuming a rupture velocity we can estimate a source dimension. Given simple models for uniform stress drop on a fault, we can infer the relation between stress drop, moment, and corner frequency. Second, from the inversion of teleseismic body waves to infer spatially varying slip on the fault, we estimate the stress change from the slip distribution. Our group's research focuses on establishing the accuracy of those estimate, the validity of the assumptions, and finding the control on stress drop through correlation with source depth, mechanism, and structure.
