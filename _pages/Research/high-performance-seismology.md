# High-Performance Seismology
---
We are developing tools to process large data sets in seismology for earthquake detection, classification, large-N and large-T processing for hazard and environmental monitoring. Our tools are scalable from single-CPU laptops to clusters, cloud computing, and to CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing.
