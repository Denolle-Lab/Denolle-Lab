# Seismic Monitoring of the Environment
---
#### We use the ambient seismic field to construct the impulse response of the Earth and monitor its changes through time. We establish connections between the perturbations of the shallowest layers due to local environmental constraints such as temperature, pressure, and precipitation. Our group focuses on various scale of the ground water system, from deep and confined aquifers (~ 1 km), to shallow and unconfined aquifers (< 100 m), and to soil moisture ( < 1m).
