# Ground Motions
---
#### We predict the long period ground motion from future large earthquakes.  We use the ambient seismic field Green's function that mainly contain surface waves to predict the waveforms of shallow realistic point sources. We map the peak ground motion and its duration at various frequencies of interest to infrastructures in urban environment.

## Seismic Amplification in sedimentary basin
When seismic waves travel through soft sediments, and particularly in basins, they get trapped, their amplitude amplify and the duration of strong shaking increases. In Japan, I use the Metropolitan Seismic Observatory network (MeSO-net) to investigate natural resonance under Tokyo. The Kanto basin is 4km deep, with poorly consolidated sediments (Vs~ 500 m/s) surrounded by stiff bedrock.

Figure 2 (left): I use about 370 stations from Hi-net network (black triangles) and 296 station from the MeSO-net (red triangles).             |  Figure3 (right): Seismic amplification recorded in MeSO-net receivers filtered around 6 seconds. The contour lines are the basement of the sedimentary basin and show correlation between amplification and basin depth (from Denolle et al., 2014b).

When seismic waves hit interfaces with strong impedance, such as basin wall, they reflect, refract and convert to other phase. With dense seismic networks, we can retrieve such effect using the ambient seismic field. We calculate the vertial-to-vertical corelation, expecting the fundamental mode of surface waves to dominate.

The fast arrival resembles a Rayleigh waves, the and second arrival resembles a Love wave. This conversion from Rayleigh-to-Love may be due to then shallow dipping eastern basin edge.

 
 

## Virtual Earthquakes
We can use the Green's functions from the ambient seismic field to directly predict ground motion. The 9 components of the ambient seismic field Green's tensor are the responses of the Earth to impulse forces located at the depth of the virtual source, i.e. at the surface. Realistic earthquakes are buried and have a dislocation mechanism that can be represented as a double couple. Once we know the surface-wave excitation at the virtual source location, we can correct the surface-wave impulse responses to predict ground motion.

 We can also prescribe kinematically large sources that we discretize into point sources. For each point source, we correct for depth, mechanism, timing of event according to the slip history, and sum over all sources using the principle of superposition. We have focused our effort on predicting scenario earthquakes on the San Andrea Fault (Denolle et al 2014a) and on the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (Denolle et al, 2017)
