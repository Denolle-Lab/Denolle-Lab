# Open positions
---
**For the time being, I no longer have postdoctoral positions open in my group because of limited funds and time.**

I am always interested in hiring **graduate students**! 


The group is highly motivated to host **undergraduate researchers**! Several specific projects are posted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9Qbx1dYNyfoMFFRE5Gmry2erZa7y5h8zgLSRjc-v_M/edit?usp=sharing). Marine supports research experience using hourly-rate compensation throughout the year, and or through fellowship and other opportunities.

### How to apply
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please read our group guidelines [here](https://github.com/Denolle-Lab/working_as_a_group/blob/main/onboarding.md).

For PhD applications, look over the ESS webpage [here](https://ess.uw.edu/education/graduate-program/how-to-apply/). We do not take GREs anymore, but TOEFL scores are still necessary.

My rubric for graduate admissions is the following:
### Rubric for Graduate Student Admissions  
**Geophysics and Data Science Research Program**  

The following rubric outlines the evaluation criteria and weighting system for selecting top candidates (top 2%) for the graduate program. Each criterion is scored on a scale of **1–5**, with 5 being the highest. Candidates must demonstrate excellence across all categories to align with the program's rigorous expectations.

### **Evaluation Categories and Criteria**  

#### **1. Academic Excellence (25%)**  
- **Coursework Performance**: Strong GPA (ideally ≥3.9 on a 4.0 scale or equivalent) in relevant fields, including geophysics, physics, math, computer science, or engineering.  
  - **5**: Exceptional GPA with honors, dean’s list, or equivalent.  
  - **4**: Strong GPA, top 10% of cohort.  
  - **3**: Average GPA with one or two notable exceptions.  
  - **2**: Below-average performance in key areas.  
  - **1**: Insufficient performance in core coursework.  

#### **2. Quantitative and Analytical Skills (20%)**  
- **Demonstrated Skills**: Excellence in quantitative disciplines (e.g., mathematics, statistics, numerical modeling). Evidence from coursework, research, or standardized exams (e.g., GRE, if available).  
  - **5**: Exceptional quantitative performance and creative problem-solving in complex scenarios.  
  - **4**: Strong skills, demonstrated through advanced coursework or projects.  
  - **3**: Moderate proficiency, with gaps in advanced applications.  
  - **2**: Limited evidence of quantitative aptitude.  
  - **1**: Minimal evidence of quantitative skills.  

#### **3. Potential for Advanced Software Engineering (20%)**  
- **Evidence**: Familiarity or proficiency with programming languages (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, C++), software development, data management, or computational frameworks. Experience in version control, large-scale simulations, or open-source contributions is a plus.  
  - **5**: Demonstrated expertise in advanced coding, independent software projects, or impactful computational work.  
  - **4**: Proficient programming skills with evidence from prior research or internships.  
  - **3**: Basic coding knowledge with limited application.  
  - **2**: Minimal exposure to software engineering principles.  
  - **1**: No evidence of computational skills.  

#### **4. Research Potential and Big Science Readiness (20%)**  
- **Focus on Big Science**: Motivation and ability to tackle interdisciplinary, large-scale scientific challenges. Demonstrated through research experience, publications, presentations, or problem statements in essays.  
  - **5**: Strongly articulated vision and evidence of readiness to contribute to cutting-edge geophysics and data science.  
  - **4**: Good alignment with big science goals but with room for growth.  
  - **3**: Moderate understanding of interdisciplinary challenges.  
  - **2**: Limited awareness or focus on big science questions.  
  - **1**: Lacks alignment with program research goals.  

#### **5. Focus and Dedication to Long-Term Projects (15%)**  
- **Evidence of Commitment**: Sustained engagement in long-term academic, research, or professional projects. Demonstrated ability to handle complex, multi-year endeavors.  
  - **5**: Clear evidence of dedication to multi-year projects with impactful outcomes.  
  - **4**: Strong commitment but shorter duration or less complexity.  
  - **3**: Moderate evidence of commitment, with some gaps in focus.  
  - **2**: Minimal evidence of long-term focus.  
  - **1**: Lacks sustained engagement in long-term efforts.  

#### **6. Letters of Recommendation (15%)**  
- **Strength and Specificity**: Letters must provide unequivocal endorsement of the applicant’s potential for advanced study and research. Strong letters should highlight:  
  1. The student’s intellectual potential, focus, and quantitative and computational skills.  
  2. The student’s ability to excel in long-term projects.  
  3. Evidence that the student is among the strongest of their cohort and prepared for the program’s rigorous demands.  
  - **5**: Enthusiastic, detailed endorsements that show no hesitation and clearly place the student among the strongest of their peers.  
  - **4**: Strong letters with detailed examples of potential, but slightly less specificity or enthusiasm.  
  - **3**: Positive but generic letters, with no significant endorsements of exceptional potential.  
  - **2**: Neutral letters that fail to provide clear evidence of suitability.  
  - **1**: Weak or hesitant recommendations.  

#### **7. Personal Statement (10%)**  
- **Clarity and Vision**: Well-articulated career goals, alignment with program, and demonstration of intellectual curiosity and motivation.  
  - **5**: Exceptional statement with clear alignment to program goals and strong narrative.  
  - **4**: Strong statement with minor weaknesses.  
  - **3**: Adequate statement with room for improvement.  
  - **2**: Unfocused or unclear statement.  
  - **1**: Poorly written or irrelevant statement.
